<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Oil-free Scroll Vacuum Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-sided Scroll</li><li>Double-sided Scroll</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Oil-free scroll vacuum pumps are divided into two main market types: single-sided scroll and double-sided scroll. Single-sided scroll pumps have one scroll orbiting in a fixed spiral, creating a series of crescent-shaped pockets that trap and compress gas. Double-sided scroll pumps have two scrolls, one stationary and one orbiting, allowing for increased efficiency and vacuum levels. Both types of pumps are popular in applications where oil contamination is a concern, such as in semiconductor manufacturing and research laboratories.</p></p>
