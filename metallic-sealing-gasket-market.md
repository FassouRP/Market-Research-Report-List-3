<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Metallic Sealing Gasket Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Round</li><li>Non-circular</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Metallic sealing gaskets are classified into two main types based on their shape: round and non-circular. Round gaskets are circular in shape and are commonly used in applications where a circular seal is required, such as pipes and valves. Non-circular gaskets, on the other hand, have irregular shapes to fit specific sealing requirements. These gaskets are used in specialized applications where standard round gaskets may not provide an effective seal, such as in flanges with irregular shapes or non-standard sizes.</p></p>
