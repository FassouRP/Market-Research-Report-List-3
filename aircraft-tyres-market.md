<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aircraft Tyres Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial</li><li>Bias</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Aircraft tyres are categorized into two main types: radial and bias. Radial tyres are constructed with cords that run at a 90-degree angle to the direction of travel, providing better flexibility and shock absorption. Bias tyres, on the other hand, have cords that are laid at alternate angles, leading to a stiffer and more durable structure. The choice between radial and bias tyres depends on factors such as aircraft size, weight, speed, and operational conditions. Both types play a crucial role in ensuring safe and efficient aircraft operations.</p></p>
