<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fume Hoods Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ductless Fume Hoods</li><li>Ducted Fume Hoods</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fume hoods are essential equipment used in laboratories to control and remove hazardous fumes, vapors, and gases. Ductless fume hoods, also known as recirculating fume hoods, utilize filters to capture and clean the air before recirculating it back into the laboratory. On the other hand, ducted fume hoods extract the contaminated air through a ventilation system, expelling it outside the building. The market for fume hoods encompasses these two types, offering different options to cater to the specific needs of laboratories in terms of air safety and pollutant management.</p></p>
