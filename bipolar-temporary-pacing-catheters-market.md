<p><strong>The Bipolar Temporary Pacing Catheters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Temporary Pacing Catheters without Balloon</li><li>Temporary Pacing Catheters with Balloon</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bipolar Temporary Pacing Catheters are medical devices used in cardiac patients to deliver electrical impulses to the heart. There are two main types of temporary pacing catheters: those with and without a balloon. Temporary Pacing Catheters without Balloon are inserted directly into the heart's chambers to provide pacing, while Temporary Pacing Catheters with Balloon include an inflatable balloon at the tip to help stabilize the catheter and improve pacing accuracy. Both types of catheters are essential tools for managing cardiac rhythm disorders in patients.</p></p>
