<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Silica for S-SBR Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Treated Silica</li><li>Untreated Silica</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Silica is commonly used as a reinforcing filler in solution-polymerized styrene-butadiene rubber (S-SBR) to enhance its mechanical properties. Treated silica has been chemically modified to improve dispersion within the rubber matrix, leading to better reinforcement and reduced rolling resistance. Untreated silica, on the other hand, is used as a cost-effective alternative but may result in lower reinforcement and higher hysteresis. Both types of silica play a crucial role in the S-SBR market, catering to different needs and preferences of manufacturers.</p></p>
