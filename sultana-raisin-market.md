<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sultana (Raisin) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Natural Dry</li><li>Artificial Dry</li></ul></p>

Natural dry sultanas are naturally sun-dried, a traditional and time-consuming process that allows the fruit to retain its natural flavor and texture. Artificial dry sultanas, on the other hand, undergo a faster drying process using artificial methods, such as dehydration machines, which accelerates the drying time.
