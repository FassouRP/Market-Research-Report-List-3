<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Suspended-Level Viscometer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Calibrated</li><li>Uncalibrated</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Suspended-level viscometers are categorized based on their calibration methods. Calibrated viscometers are tested and adjusted to ensure accurate measurements, making them reliable for precise viscosity readings. On the other hand, uncalibrated viscometers do not undergo this testing process and may have variations in their measurements, hence they are considered less accurate. Users may choose based on the level of accuracy required for their specific application, with calibrated viscometers being suitable for precise measurements and uncalibrated viscometers being more cost-effective options for general use.</p></p>
