<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The NdFeB Permanent Magnetic Materials Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sintered NdFeB</li><li>Bonded NdFeB</li></ul></p>
<p><p>NdFeB permanent magnetic materials are divided into two main types: sintered NdFeB and bonded NdFeB. Sintered NdFeB magnets are made by compacting and sintering fine NdFeB powder, resulting in high magnetic properties and mechanical strength. On the other hand, bonded NdFeB magnets are produced by mixing NdFeB powder with a polymer binder, allowing for complex shapes and sizes to be formed. Sintered NdFeB magnets are commonly used in high-performance applications, while bonded NdFeB magnets are more cost-effective and suitable for less demanding uses.</p></p>
