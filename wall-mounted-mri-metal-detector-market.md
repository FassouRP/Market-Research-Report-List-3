<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wall-mounted MRI Metal Detector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Pillar System</li><li>Double Pillars System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Wall-mounted MRI metal detectors come in two main types: single pillar system and double pillars system. Single pillar systems have a single vertical pillar supporting the detector, making them ideal for smaller spaces or installations where space is limited. On the other hand, double pillars systems have two vertical pillars for added stability and support, making them suitable for larger areas or where the detector needs to be mounted at a greater distance from the wall. Each type has its unique benefits and is selected based on specific requirements.</p></p>
